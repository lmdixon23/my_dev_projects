# Rust Decentralized Voting

## Overview

**Rust_Decentralized_Voting** is a decentralized voting protocol implemented in Rust, designed to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof elections. This protocol leverages Rust's safety and performance features to deliver a reliable voting system that prevents fraud and guarantees voter anonymity.

## Key Features

- **Secure and Anonymous Voting**: Ensures that each vote is confidential and that voters' identities are protected.
- **Transparent Vote Tallying**: All votes are tallied transparently, with results being verifiable by all participants.
- **Double Voting Prevention**: Implements mechanisms to prevent voters from casting more than one vote, ensuring fairness in the election process.

## Example Usage

After running the project, you can observe the following sequence of operations:

- **Voter Registration**: Voters are securely registered with unique identifiers.
- **Vote Submission**: Votes are cast anonymously and securely, with checks in place to prevent double voting.
- **Vote Tallying**: Votes are tallied in a transparent manner, ensuring that the results are accurate and verifiable.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Security**: Further improvements to cryptographic techniques to ensure even greater security.
- **Scalability Improvements**: Optimization for handling larger-scale elections with more participants and votes.

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Rust
- **Security Mechanisms**: Cryptographic techniques to ensure anonymity and prevent double voting
