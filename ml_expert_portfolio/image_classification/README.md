# Image Classification using Transfer Learning

## Overview

**Image_Classification_Transfer_Learning** is a deep learning project that leverages transfer learning to classify images into various categories using pre-trained models like VGG16. This project is designed to run efficiently on Google's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) in Google Colab, enabling faster training times and the ability to work with large datasets.

## Key Features

- **TPU Acceleration**: Utilizing Google's TPU in Colab for faster model training and efficient processing of large datasets.
- **Transfer Learning**: Employing pre-trained CNN models like VGG16 to extract features from images, enhancing performance and reducing the need for extensive training.
- **Custom Classification**: Fine-tuning the pre-trained models for specific image classification tasks, allowing for flexibility across different datasets and applications.

## Example Usage

After setting up and running the project, the following operations will be performed:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Images are loaded and preprocessed to the required format for the model.
- **Model Training**: The pre-trained model (VGG16) is fine-tuned on the given dataset, and checkpoints are saved during training.
- **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on a test set, and metrics such as accuracy are reported.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Model Performance**: Exploring additional pre-trained models and fine-tuning techniques to further improve classification accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implementing more advanced data augmentation strategies to improve model generalization.
- **Deployment Options**: Expanding deployment options to include containerization with Docker and cloud deployment with AWS or GCP.

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Hardware**: Google Colab TPU for accelerated training
